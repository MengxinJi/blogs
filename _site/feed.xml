&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the causal relationship of interest?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the most interesting research in social science is about cause and effect&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A causal relationship is useful for making predictions about the consequences of changing circumstances or policies; it tells us what would happen in alternative or counterfactual worlds.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The experiment that could ideally be used to capture the causal effect of interest.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ideal experiments are most ofter hypothetical&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is your identification strategy?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Angrist and Krueger (1999) used the term identification strategy to describe the manner in which a researcher uses observational data (i.e., data not generated by a randomized trial) to approximate a real experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is your mode of statistical inference?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The answer to this question describes the population to be studied, the sample to be used, and the assumptions made when constructing standard errors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most credible and influential research designs use random assignment. There are three problems we want to emphasize about experiments in uncovering causal effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-selection-problem&quot;&gt;The Selection Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we define a binary random variable D = 0 or 1. The outcome is denoted by Y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mengxinji.github.io/Blog/images/selectionbias.png&quot; alt=&quot;Average Treatment Effect&quot; style=&quot;float:right; padding:16px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other word, Y(0i) is the health status of an individual had he not gone to the hospital and Y(1i) is the individual’s health status if he goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can rewrite the observed outcome Y(i) = Y(0i) + (Y(1i) - Y(0i)) * D(i). And we denote Y(1i) - Y(0i) as the causal effect of hospitalization for an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comparison of average health conditional on hospitalization status is formally linked to the average causal effect as the following explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first term (average treatment effect on treated) is the average causal effect of hospitalization on those who were hospitalized while the second term is the selection bias, which is the difference in average &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;Y_{0i}&lt;/script&gt; between those who were and were not hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Random assignment of D(i) solves the selection problem because random assignment makes D(i) independent of potential outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quasi-experimental study of class size by &lt;a href=&quot;https://economics.mit.edu/files/8273&quot;&gt;Angrist and Lavy (1999)&lt;/a&gt; illustrates the manner in which non-experimental data can be analyzed in an experimental spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;regression-analysis-of-experiments&quot;&gt;Regression Analysis of Experiments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regression is a useful tool for the study of causal questions, including the analysis of data from experiments. Suppose (for now) that the treatment effect is the same for everyone, say Y(1i) - Y(0i) , a constant. Selection bias amounts to correlation between the regression error term and the regressor, D(i). Regression plays an exceptionally important role in empirical economic research. Some regressions are simply descriptive tools, as in much of the research on earnings inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;
